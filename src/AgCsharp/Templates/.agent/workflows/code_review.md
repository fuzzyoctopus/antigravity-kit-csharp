description: A comprehensive code review workflow providing a systematic checklist for reviewing code before merging to main branch. Covers naming conventions, architecture design (Single Responsibility, Dependency Injection, layer boundaries), error handling best practices, security considerations (SQL injection prevention, authorization, input validation), performance optimization (async/await, N+1 queries, indexing), testing standards (AAA pattern, edge cases), Presenter/View design principles, and database migration reviews. Includes severity levels for review comments (Blocker, Major, Minor, Nitpick, Suggestion) with templates, and defines clear approval criteria.

# Workflow: Code Review

## Overview
Systematic checklist for reviewing code before merging to main branch.

## Pre-Review Setup

1. Pull the latest changes from the feature branch
2. Ensure the code builds successfully
3. Run all tests locally
4. Review the PR description and linked issues

---

## Code Review Checklist

### 1. Naming & Readability

- [ ] **Class names** are descriptive and use PascalCase
- [ ] **Method names** clearly describe their purpose
- [ ] **Variable names** are meaningful (avoid single letters except loops)
- [ ] **No magic numbers** - use constants or enums
- [ ] **Comments** explain "why", not "what"
- [ ] **Code is self-documenting** - minimal comments needed

```csharp
// ❌ Bad
var x = GetData();
if (x.Status == 1) { }

// ✅ Good
var customer = await GetCustomerAsync(customerId);
if (customer.Status == CustomerStatus.Active) { }
```

### 2. Architecture & Design

- [ ] **Single Responsibility** - each class/method does one thing
- [ ] **Dependency Injection** - no `new` for services
- [ ] **Layer boundaries** - no infrastructure in domain
- [ ] **No circular dependencies**
- [ ] **Proper abstraction level** - not over-engineered

```csharp
// ❌ Bad - Repository in Form
public partial class OrderForm : Form
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context; // Direct DB access
}

// ✅ Good - Proper layering
public class OrderPresenter
{
    private readonly ISender _sender; // Uses MediatR
}
```

### 3. Error Handling

- [ ] **No empty catch blocks**
- [ ] **Specific exceptions** caught before general
- [ ] **Errors logged** with appropriate level
- [ ] **Result pattern** used instead of exceptions for expected failures
- [ ] **Validation** at boundaries

```csharp
// ❌ Bad
try { } catch { } // Silent failure

// ✅ Good
try
{
    await ProcessOrderAsync(order);
}
catch (ExternalServiceException ex)
{
    _logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to process order {OrderId}", order.Id);
    throw;
}
```

### 4. Security

- [ ] **No SQL injection** - parameterized queries only
- [ ] **No sensitive data in logs** (passwords, tokens, PII)
- [ ] **Authorization checks** on commands/actions
- [ ] **Input validation** on all user input
- [ ] **No hardcoded secrets**

```csharp
// ❌ Bad - SQL Injection risk
var sql = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email = '{email}'";

// ✅ Good
var user = await context.Users.FirstOrDefaultAsync(u => u.Email == email);
```

### 5. Performance

- [ ] **Async/await** used correctly for I/O
- [ ] **No N+1 queries** - use Include() or projection
- [ ] **AsNoTracking()** for read-only queries
- [ ] **Proper indexing** considered for new columns
- [ ] **No blocking calls** (.Result, .Wait())

```csharp
// ❌ Bad - N+1 query
foreach (var order in orders)
{
    var customer = await _context.Customers.FindAsync(order.CustomerId);
}

// ✅ Good - Eager loading
var orders = await _context.Orders.Include(o => o.Customer).ToListAsync();
```

### 6. Testing

- [ ] **Unit tests** for business logic
- [ ] **Tests follow AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- [ ] **Edge cases covered** (null, empty, boundaries)
- [ ] **Test names** are descriptive
- [ ] **No test dependencies** on other tests

```csharp
// ✅ Good test structure
[Fact]
public async Task CreateOrder_ShouldFail_WhenCustomerIsInactive()
{
    // Arrange
    var customer = CreateInactiveCustomer();
    
    // Act
    var result = await _service.CreateOrderAsync(customer.Id, items);
    
    // Assert
    result.IsFailure.Should().BeTrue();
    result.Error.Should().Contain("inactive");
}
```

### 7. Internal Service Design

- [ ] **Result Pattern** used effectively instead of throwing exceptions for control flow
- [ ] **DTOs** used for data transfer instead of domain entities directly
- [ ] **Clear method signatures** (intention-revealing)
- [ ] **No UI logic** leaking into Application/Domain services
- [ ] **CancellationTokens** passed down the stack

### 8. Database

- [ ] **Migrations** are correct and reversible
- [ ] **No breaking changes** to existing data
- [ ] **Indexes** added for frequently queried columns
- [ ] **Foreign keys** properly configured
- [ ] **Data types** appropriate for the data

## Review Comments Guide

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Action Required |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 🔴 **Blocker** | Security issue, data loss risk, build break | Must fix before merge |
| 🟠 **Major** | Bug, missing validation, incorrect logic | Should fix before merge |
| 🟡 **Minor** | Code style, naming, small improvements | Can fix or discuss |
| 🟢 **Nitpick** | Personal preference, optional | Nice to have |
| 💡 **Suggestion** | Alternative approach, learning | For discussion |

### Comment Templates

```markdown
🔴 **BLOCKER**: SQL Injection vulnerability
This query is vulnerable to SQL injection. Use parameterized queries.

🟠 **MAJOR**: Missing null check
`customer` can be null here but isn't checked before accessing properties.

🟡 **MINOR**: Consider renaming
`ProcessData` doesn't clearly describe what this method does. 
Consider `CalculateOrderTotal`.

💡 **SUGGESTION**: Alternative approach
Consider using the specification pattern here for more flexible querying.
```

## Post-Review

1. **Respond to all comments** - resolve or discuss
2. **Request re-review** after changes
3. **Squash commits** if needed before merge
4. **Update documentation** if behavior changed
5. **Notify team** of significant changes

---

## Approval Criteria

A PR can be approved when:

- [ ] All blockers are resolved
- [ ] All major issues are fixed
- [ ] Tests pass in CI/CD
- [ ] At least one approval from team member
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Documentation is updated (if needed)
